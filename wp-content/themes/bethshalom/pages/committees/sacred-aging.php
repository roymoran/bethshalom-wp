    <div class="committee-info">On behalf of Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation, we are pleased to invite seniors 55 and up to participate in our “Sacred Aging Program. </div>
    <div class="committee-info">According to the Journal of Gerontological Nursing “interpersonal communication is central to the aging process and provides the link between health and successful aging.” Social interaction provides support for older adults, positively affects their self esteem and ability to cope with stress and depression, and helps them maintain a societal role. Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation Senior Programs’ primary emphasis is placed on the socializing benefit of interpersonal communication with group activities. This will encourage the seniors to socialize and interact, and discourage withdrawal and isolation.</div>
    <div class="committee-info">We hope that you will come out enjoy and participate in the program that we have developed. This program is allowing Beth Shalom BZEHC to fulfill our motto, “Keeping the Faith from Generation to Generation.</div>
    <div class="committee-info">We are presently operating through grant money from Jewish Healing Network of Chicago, Congregation Connection Program and our Congregation, Beth Shalom BZEHC. Our grant ends November 30, 2008; we are fund raising and accepting donations to help keep our program going.</div>
