    <div class="committee-info">Anshay Chayil (Men of Valor), the men’s auxiliary of Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation was formed in 1994. With just a few members present, the brotherhood made the commitment to assist our Rabbi and the Gabbaim in the flow and presentation of all religious services. Preparing for special occasions such as Pesach and Sh’vuot provides not only an opportunity for camaraderie and friendship amongst the brothers, but also provides an opportunity to work together to insure blessed and peaceful Holy Days.</div>
    <div class="committee-info">We protect our women, children and visitors by providing assistance and security at all congregational functions. Anshay Chayil also provides opportunities for education, such as Hebrew classes, classes for the Gabbaim, and studies in history as they relate to our Israelite ancestry. Members of the brotherhood make it their duty to visit with the elders and provide support and assistance at all times.</div>
    <div class="committee-info">Through fundraisers during the year, we work to assist our congregation by being an additional source of financial support. All adult males in the congregation are strongly encouraged to join and help make Anshay Chayil an important part of Beth Shalom B’nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation.</div>
    <div class="committee-info">Our motto is simple:<br>“With the Most High we can, in the spirit of love we will” </div>
